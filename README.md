# mygettext
Simple gettext module in Python

The original gettext library simply does not work for me. After searching the web for solutios I thought it would be easier to rewrite it to support my simple needs.

I hope that others that know Python better then I do will help me improve it.

This module will read PO files as it is easier for me to parse text files.
It works only for UTF-8, no other encodings are currently supported.
